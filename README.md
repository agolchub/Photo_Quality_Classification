# Photo Quality Classification Using Deep Learning - README

To run the code please clone the repo:

There are two Jupyter notebooks one for the 80/10/10 split and another for the 60/20/20 split. The code is almost identical, it is only the split of the data which is different.

The traffic image classification task is only implemented for the 80/10/10 split.

In the same folder that you downloaded, also create a folder called "fig" and another called "fig2". These two folders are used to save figures such as confusion matrices and training/val loss history charts. 

It is highly recommended to run this on a system that has a Tensorflow compatible GPU with the Cuda toolkits installed. 

To run the notebooks, just open the notebook and Run All. With GPU training only takes about 30-40 minutes.
